My configuration files for various tools I use on Windows.
* PyCharm settings (including keymaps, inspections, themes and plugins)
* .`commands/` contains several batch files, mostly for emulating bash commands
* Windows Terminal settings
* Notepad++ settings

I don't include github config currently because I often have multiple github arrangements depending if I'm at work or doing personal projects.
